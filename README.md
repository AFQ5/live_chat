LiveChat is a real-time interactive chat project built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). It can be integrated directly with an n8n workflow.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Notes

* There is an **n8n.json** file included with the project. You can upload it to n8n to get the exact same workflow ready to use.
* After creating any new workflow in n8n, click the **three dots (¬∑¬∑¬∑)** at the top of the workflow page, then select **"Import from File..."** and upload the `n8n.json` file from this project. This will instantly create the same workflow for you‚Äîno manual setup needed!
* You can run n8n locally using Docker, or use n8n Cloud. Node.js is required to run Angular locally.
